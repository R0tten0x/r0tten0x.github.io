  <h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
  <p class="date">Effective Date: June 23, 2025</p>

  <h2>Purpose and Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>DateVault is an entertainment app for personal use only. All content is intended for humor, meme creation, and entertainment. This app does not provide professional advice or factual verification of user-generated content.</p>
  <p>DateVault is not intended for harassment, defamation, or any malicious use. Use of the App for such purposes is strictly prohibited.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>a. Information You Provide</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Date entries, Photos:</strong> All data you enter (including photos and text) is stored locally on your device only. We do not access, transmit, or store your content on any external server.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings and Preferences:</strong> All app settings and theme preferences are saved on your device.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>b. Automatically Collected Information</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device and Usage Data:</strong> DateVault does not collect analytics, usage statistics, or any personal data. Minimal device info may be collected by Apple or the App Store as part of their platform operations.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Your Information Is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All content remains on your device and is never transmitted unless you export it or back up your device.</li>
    <li>When exporting or sharing meme images, DateVault automatically redacts personal details including faces (blurred) and names (black bar). This is enforced for all users (including paid users) for privacy and legal reasons.</li>
    <li>We do not store your entries, photos, or exports on our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Respect for Privacy of Others</h2>
  <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of both the user and any individuals depicted in entries. All exported memes will automatically redact faces and names, regardless of user settings or subscription tier. We strongly discourage any attempts to circumvent these protections.</p>

  <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>You are solely responsible for how you share or distribute exported meme images outside the App. DateVault cannot control, monitor, or be held liable for the use of content once it has been exported from your device. Users are expected to respect the privacy and rights of others when sharing content created within the App.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob (Google LLC):</strong> DateVault uses AdMob to serve in-app advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers, usage data, and other information in accordance with its <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple (iOS):</strong> Apple may collect aggregated, anonymized device analytics according to your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>No third-party SDKs:</strong> DateVault does not use other third-party advertising or analytics SDKs that access your private data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>DateVault offers optional in-app purchases (IAPs) to remove advertising and/or export watermarks. All purchase transactions are processed securely by Apple’s App Store. We do not receive or store any payment or personal billing information.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to any third parties. All data stays on your device, unless you choose to export content or back up your device via iCloud or similar Apple services.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>All entries, photos, and settings remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app.</p>
  <p>If you wish to delete all data, simply delete the app to remove all local content from your device.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard security practices to protect your information, but no system is completely secure. Data never leaves your device unless you export it yourself.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If significant changes occur, you will be notified within the App or by other appropriate means.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>For any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, use the in-app feedback option or contact us via the support link in Settings.</p>
