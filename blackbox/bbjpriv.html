  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>a. Information You Provide</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Journals, Affirmations, Photos:</strong> All personal entries, affirmations, and any photos you use in the App are stored locally on your device. We do not access, transmit, or store your journal content or photos on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings and Preferences:</strong> Your app settings and theme preferences are also stored only on your device.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>b. Automatically Collected Information</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device and Usage Data:</strong> The App itself does not collect usage analytics or personal data. However, certain minimal device information may be collected by Apple or by third-party services (see below).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Your Information Is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> All personal journal content and preferences remain on your device and are never uploaded, shared, or transmitted unless you explicitly export or back up your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> If you enable notifications, we use them solely to remind you to journal. Notification preferences are stored on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Affirmation and Theme Fetching:</strong> The app may fetch affirmation categories and visual themes from external sources. No personal information is sent during these requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>On-Device Mood Analyzer</h2>
  <p>The App includes a mood analysis feature powered by a machine learning model that runs exclusively on your device. No journal content, mood inferences, or other personal data processed by this feature is transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>
  <p>The mood analyzer is intended for informational and general wellness purposes only. The inferences it generates may be inaccurate or incomplete, and should not be relied upon as a sole or definitive source for mental health evaluation, diagnosis, or advice.</p>
  <p>You acknowledge and agree that use of the mood analyzer is at your own risk, and the App and its developers disclaim any liability for actions taken based on its outputs. If you have concerns about your mental health, please consult a qualified professional.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google LLC):</strong> The App uses Firebase for authentication and for fetching some remote resources (such as ML models or public content). Only anonymous authentication tokens or app instance identifiers are sent as required for these functions. No personal journal content or photos are sent to Firebase. Optional analytics, if enabled by default, are limited and anonymized. For more details, see <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple (iOS):</strong> Apple may collect aggregated, anonymized device analytics in accordance with your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Content Fetching:</strong> The App fetches public content, such as the privacy policy itself, from trusted URLs (e.g., GitHub). No personal data is transmitted in these requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal data with any third parties. Your data stays on your device, unless you choose to share it or back up your device via Apple iCloud or similar services.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>All your entries and settings remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app.</p>
  <p>If you wish to export or delete your data, you can do so by using any in-app feature provided, or by deleting the app to remove all local data.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard security practices to protect your information. However, please be aware that no system is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you within the App or by other means.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, please use the feedback option in Settings.</p>
